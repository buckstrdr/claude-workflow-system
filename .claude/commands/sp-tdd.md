description: Test-Driven Development workflow (write tests first, watch fail, implement)
---

Invoke the superpowers:test-driven-development skill to follow strict TDD practice: write the test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass.

Use this when implementing ANY feature or bugfix to ensure tests actually verify behavior.
