Run the broadcast communication test to verify all 12 Claude instances (including orchestrator) can communicate via the MCP message store and inbox watchers are functioning.

Execute: python3 scripts/orchestrator/broadcast_test.py --timeout 10

This will:
1. Send broadcast message to all 11 roles via MCP message store (using direct_broadcast.py)
2. Wait 10 seconds for inbox watchers to detect messages and trigger autonomous responses
3. Collect responses from each role's MCP inbox
4. Display formatted results table showing:
   - Response rate (X/11 roles, excluding sender)
   - Status of each role
   - Response times
   - Overall system health
5. Mark test response messages as read automatically

Expected output when healthy:
✅ Responses received: 11/11 (100%)
✅ Message passing infrastructure (MCP Store): HEALTHY
✅ Inbox watchers: OPERATIONAL (all 12 roles)
✅ Autonomous messaging: WORKING

## Autonomous Messaging System

The system monitors for **ANY** messages (not just broadcast tests):

**Message Types Handled:**
- **Broadcast tests** → Autonomous response
- **Status requests** → Autonomous response
- **Task assignments** → Trigger Claude interactively
- **Code/spec reviews** → Trigger Claude interactively
- **Questions** → Trigger Claude interactively
- **Notifications** → Mark read (no action)

**How It Works:**
1. Inbox watcher (scripts/roles/inbox_watcher.sh) runs every 3 seconds
2. Generic handler (scripts/roles/handle_messages.py) classifies message intent
3. Simple messages get autonomous responses (no human intervention)
4. Complex messages trigger Claude interactively via tmux send-keys + Enter

Use this before starting feature work to verify:
- All 12 instances are operational
- MCP message store is working
- Inbox watchers are detecting ALL messages (not just broadcast tests)
- Autonomous message handling is functioning for simple messages
- Interactive triggering works for complex messages
- All roles can respond without manual intervention
